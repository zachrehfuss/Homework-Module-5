In this repo, you will find a folder title "Starter_Code" that houses a folder called "Pymaceuticals."
Inside the Pymaceuticals file there is my code and a folder titled "data" that 
has both CSVs that I merge my Dataframe on.

For the Code, I used Xpert learning assistant to fix my code for the For loop
on the IQR. I also used it to help me figure out the aggregate method 
of creating my dataframe. I worked with my peer Matt on creating a bar chart
in Pandas and the initial code for my pie charts. I worked with my peer
Alice on plotting a bar chart with PyPlot and she corrected the errors in the code.
With my tutor Lucas he helped me tweek the code for cleaning the dataframe
and removing the duplicate along with tweaking the pie graph code that originally
had the wrong percentages. Alongside that he helped fix my code for finding outliers
as the outlier was not being generated and fixing the code for the quartiles.
Finally lucas helped me generate the code the line and scatter plots as well
as the linear regression line.
